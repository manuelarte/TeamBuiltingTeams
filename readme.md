## Gradle linter

The project contains a plugin called gradle linter.  
It prevents you from building/running if dependencies are transient while should be direct referenced, also if you have unused direct dependencies.

### Automated Gradle Linter Fixes

Make sure you stage `build.gradle` if any changes were made, then run `gradle fixGradleLint` or `gradle fGL` for short.
Confirm and reorder the changes to dependencies.

## Testing
